**A project creating an e-commerce website for people interested in independent film.**

## Description

It was important for me to build a website and design that looked modern and simple, highlighting the most important featured. The website should be easy to navigate and contains a big top navigation menu on desktop mode, while dropping it down to the bottom for mobile mode.

This website is still under construction and my goal is to make it seamless, and enhance loadtime.
